        <h3>🌟 Our Story</h3>
        <p>
            The Plate and Palette was founded with a simple yet powerful vision—to create a restaurant where 
            every dish is not just a meal, but an artistic expression. Our journey began when our head chef, 
            <strong>Chef Alexander Bennett</strong>, traveled across Europe and Asia, studying the finest 
            culinary techniques and flavors. Inspired by his experiences, he returned with a dream: to blend 
            international flavors with creative plating that turns every dish into a masterpiece.
